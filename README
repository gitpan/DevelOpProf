CHANGES

0.2  13 Aug 1998
New since 0.1
    Prepended PL_ to global variables which need it for 5.005.
    Tweaked runops_opprof to use CALLOP (for PERL_OBJECT).

0.1  10 Dec 1997
Initial release for Perl development version 5.004_50.

INSTALLATION

You need Perl 5.005 or later. This module makes use of the dynamic
runops feature included in Perl 5.005--earlier versions of Perl will
not suffice.

To build:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
